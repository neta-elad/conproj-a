## Historical Notes

### Noun classes/classifiers

Originally, there were 10 noun classes (/classifiers):

- 1 (H):  Male human \*ʔu
- 2 (H): Female human \*qʷa
- 3 (A): Large animals \*ma
- 4 (H): Winged animals (birds, bats) \*hu
- 5 (I): Small animals (critters, insects) \*ɴi
- 6 (A): Fresh water phenomena (lakes, rivers, wells, springs, rains) \*ŋu
- 7 (A): Countable edible fruits and vegetables \*hi
- 8 (I): Misc. (inanimate objects) \*qaqa
    - Originally something like "rest", "not anything else", \*qa old word for "no"?
- 9 (H+): Major deities \*laqʷi
- 10 (A+): Minor deities \*li

These were reduced to three genders:

- Human: 1, 2, 4, 9\*
- Animate: 3, 6, 7, 10\*
- Inanimate: 5, 8

\* The deities classes receive an additional "l" phone in some conjugations.
This "l" was later re-analyzed as an honorific.

### Pronouns

Originally, there were 1^st^ and 2^nd^ pronouns, 
with singular/plural distinction,
and 3^rd^ pronouns coming from demonstratives + classifier:


&{

|Pronouns|<|Singular|<|Plural|<|
|--------|-|--------|-|------|-|
|1^st^ >|| *&pr{<1sg-1>}* | **#<1sg-1>#-** | *&pr{<1pl-1>}* | **#<1pl-1>#-** |
|2^nd^ >|Masculine >|*&pr{<2sg-1>}* | **#<2sg-1>.c1#-** | *&pr{<2pl-1>}* | **#<2pl-1>#-** |
|^      |Feminine  >|^              | **#<2sg-1>.c2#-** |^  |^  |
|^      |Formal (1) >|^              | **#<2sg-1>.c10#-**|^  |^  |
|^      |Formal (2) >|^    | **#<2sg-1>.c9#-** |^  |^  |
|3^rd^ >|Human     >|*&pr{<3sg-1>}* | **#<3sg-1>.c1#-** | *&pr{<3pl-1>}* | **#<3pl-1>#-** |
|^      |Animate   >|^              | **#<3sg-1>.c3#-** | ^ | ^ |
|^      |Inanimate >|^              | **#<3sg-1>.c5#-** | ^ | ^ |

The 2^nd^ person singular pronouns used to conjugate 
according to the class of the addressee.
The ++.c10++ and ++.c9++ classes are used for two levels of formality.

### Cases

Originally, there was only the genitive case, from an old word for "home" &df{<home-1>}.

### TAMs

There were 3 verb forms: perfective, imperfective and habitual,
these combine with 4 tenses/moods: 
unmarked (realis), past, irrealis (conditional 1), past + irrealis (conditional 2).
These combine in the following ways in the modern language:

&{

| Form / Tense | Unmarked | Past | Conditional 1 | Conditional 2 |
|------|----------|------|---------------|---------------|
| Perfective >| Past | Remote/narrative past (pluperfect) | Future | Subjunctive |
| Imperfective >| Present / Present continuous | Narrative continuous | Conditional | ? |
| Habitual >| Habitual | Past habitual | ? | ? |
