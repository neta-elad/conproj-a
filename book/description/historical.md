## Historical Notes

### Noun classes/classifiers

Originally, there were 10 noun classes (/classifiers):

- 1 (H):  Male human pr[<.c1>]
- 2 (H): Female human pr[<.c2>]
- 3 (A): Large animals pr[<.c3>]
- 4 (H): Winged animals (birds, bats) pr[<.c4>]
- 5 (I): Small animals (critters, insects) pr[<.c5>]
- 6 (A): Fresh water phenomena (lakes, rivers, wells, springs, rains) pr[<.c6>]
- 7 (A): Countable edible fruits and vegetables pr[<.c7>]
- 8 (I): Misc. (inanimate objects) pr[<.c8>]
    - Originally something like "rest", "not anything else", \*qa old word for "no"?
- 9 (H+): Major deities pr[<.c9>]
- 10 (A+): Minor deities pr[<.c10>]

These were reduced to three genders:

- Human: 1, 2, 4, 9\*
- Animate: 3, 6, 7, 10\*
- Inanimate: 5, 8

\* The deities classes receive an additional "l" phone in some conjugations.
This "l" was later re-analyzed as an honorific.

### Pronouns

Originally, there were 1^st^ and 2^nd^ pronouns, 
with singular/plural distinction,
and 3^rd^ pronouns coming from demonstratives + classifier:


&{

| Pronouns |<             | Singular      | Plural      |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1^st^   >|              | >r[<1sg.>]    | >r[<1pl.>]- |
| 2^nd^   >| *Regular*   >| >r[<2sg.>]-   | >r[<2pl.>]- |
| ^        | *Formal 1*  >| >r[<2for.>]-  |<            |
| ^        | *Formal 2*  >| >r[<2hfor.>]- |<            |
| 3^rd^   >| *Human*     >| >r[<3sg-h.>]- | >r[<3pl.>]  |
| ^        | *Animate*   >| >r[<3sg-a.>]- |^            |
| ^        | *Inanimate* >| >r[<3sg-i.>]- |^            |

The 2^nd^ person formal conjugations 
(originally from the 3^rd^ person forms for deities)
are used without pronouns.

### Cases

Originally, there was only the genitive case, from an old word for "home" pr[<home>%].

### TAMs

There were 3 verb forms: perfective, imperfective and habitual,
these combine with 4 tenses/moods: 
unmarked (realis), past, irrealis (conditional 1), past + irrealis (conditional 2).
These combine in the following ways in the modern language:

&{

| Form / Tense | Unmarked | Past | Conditional 1 | Conditional 2 |
|------|----------|------|---------------|---------------|
| Perfective >| Past | Remote/narrative past (pluperfect) | Future | Subjunctive |
| Imperfective >| Present / Present continuous | Narrative continuous | Conditional | ? |
| Habitual >| Habitual | Past habitual | ? | ? |
