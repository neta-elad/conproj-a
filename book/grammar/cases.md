## Cases

$name has 5 cases: nominative, accusative, dative, locative and genitive.
The accusative also serves as a general lative.

The genitive can also be combined with other cases,
usually to create a less strict meaning:

- genitive + accusative = allative (towards)
- genitive + dative = benefactive (for the benefit of)
- genitive + locative = apudessive (adjacent to)

For the combined cases, adjectives agree with the latter one 
(i.e., not the genitive).
